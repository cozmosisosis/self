            Hi!
        </div>
        <div class="introduction">
            Welcome to my page! Thank you for giving me the oportunity to share some of my ideas with you.
            I have a passion for solving problems and thinking of solutions. Sadly some of the ideas I have
            are not easily accomplished by someone who has little resources. Some are plans for increasing
            quality and efficiency of life and society at scales that I alone am unable to put into
            practice, at least for now. The main reason why I am sharing this here is it gives me a subject
            in which I find intresting to make a website about. Though there is the small hope that this
            would manifest into something greater. Going back to the ideas I have, all of these ideas need
            research to be done to check for the viability of these concepts at scale. Despite that, I
            have a strong belief that for each one of these ideas there are means to efficiently apply
            them and the methods just need to be discovered. Thank you again for checking out my website
            and please check out my ideas below.
